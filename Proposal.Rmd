Proposal or Prospectus
You will prepare a proposal or prospectus outlining your plans for the final project by 10/21. It should contain these components:  prospective dates for progress milestones, general direction of project coursework, reliable sources for data and suggestive work. You will share it on GitHub for feedback from your peers and will also have a chance to discuss and refine your ideas in class. This process will encourage collaboration and drive learning processes.  Similarly, this will clear up confusion and provide general direction of work.
