## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Proposal or Prospectus
You will prepare a proposal or prospectus outlining your plans for the final project by 10/21. It should contain these components:  prospective dates for progress milestones, general direction of project coursework, reliable sources for data and suggestive work. You will share it on GitHub for feedback from your peers and will also have a chance to discuss and refine your ideas in class. This process will encourage collaboration and drive learning processes.  Similarly, this will clear up confusion and provide general direction of work.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
