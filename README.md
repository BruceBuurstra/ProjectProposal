Why are you doing it?
How will you know you are successful?

We are going to build an interactive shiny application using NCAA March Madness Data. Our data set contains data for every March Madness score from 1985-2021. Different pages on the application will summarize the data set in different ways. One page users can select seeds to filter the data set to those seeds and summarize the results of games played between those seeds (filter Conference, filter starting year). Another page will allow the user to filter the data set based on different individual schools matching up against each other. A third possible page will run simulations based on seeds and predict a winner as well as a score possibly.

We're doing this because were both interested in March Madness and this can help us as well as other people fill out their March Madness brackets.

We will know we are successful when this app helps us make a perfect bracket and win millions of dollars.
